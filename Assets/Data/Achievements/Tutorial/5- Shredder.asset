  - Did you like my Card ? ;)
  - You're almost a professional Collector now. The last lesson is about sharing.
  - You can use the <i>Shredder</i> to create a <i>Card Code</i> to send to your
    friends.
  - The card will be <b>Destroyed</b> in the process, but the <i>Card Code</i> can
    be used by multiple friends !
  - The last <i>Card Code</i> is <b>Copied</b> in your clipboard when you press the
    <i>Shredder</i>'s button. You only have to <b>Paste</b> it to your friends.
  - You are good to go now ! Have fun and don't forget to share some Cards back !
